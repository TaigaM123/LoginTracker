# LoginTracker
A work-in-progress Python/Google Sheets sign-in/sign-out system

Keep in mind: this is VERY work-in-progress. Expect stuff to be broken.

For a quick (but relatively controversial) way of installing everything but the service_account.json file, use `curl -sSL https://github.com/TaigaM123/LoginTracker/install.sh | bash`

Hardware:
* Raspberry Pi (can theoretically be done on any Debian/Ubuntu computer, I think? Only tested on a Raspberry Pi though)
* SD Card running Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
* USB Camera (tested with a Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000)
* USB flash drive named "LoginLogger" (no quotes, you can change the name it's looking for in main.py)
* Internet connection

TODO - How to set up the service_account.json and more stuff

Thanks @cj-plusplus!
Small portions of the Python were done by ChatGPT. I'm not sure how much time or effort it saved me though.
