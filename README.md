# LoginTracker
A work-in-progress Python/Google Sheets sign-in/sign-out system

Keep in mind: this is VERY work-in-progress. Expect stuff to be broken.

For a quick (but relatively controversial) way of installing everything but the service_account.json file, use `curl -sSL https://github.com/TaigaM123/LoginTracker/install.sh | bash`

Small portions of the Python were done by ChatGPT. I'm not sure how much time or effort it saved me though.
